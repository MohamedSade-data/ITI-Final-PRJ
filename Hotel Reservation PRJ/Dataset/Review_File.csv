When showering, the hot water goes off every 2-3 minutes for about 20-30 seconds and then only cold water comes out. The hot water then comes back again. This should be checked out. That is the only thing we didn’t like about the apartment. ,

The view was great, the apartment furnished in a modern style and equipped with everything you may need. The apartment was clean.

Examination of the entrance shows many traces of where other cars have scraped against the sides of the entrance, so it is evident that other motorists have sustained damage to their cars on this entrance. Parking on the street in front of the hotel is possible though, but it is not free, and as it is a fairly busy street, there is thus no assurance that a parked car will not be damaged there either.,

194,This is not a 4* hotel,7.8,1,"Despite the publication and price range this Is 4* is unworthy.
Hotel is completely outdated and in need of renovation.
Upon arrival the room was not cleaned, fingerprints and hairs of the previous hotel guests were abundant, and this during covid period.
The bathroom was completely worn, mold spots in and around the shower and sink, stains on walls and ceilings, taps worn, rusted and completely calcified. Windows hadn't been cleaned for weeks, the handles were literally black with dirt.
The renovation work already carried out looked more like amateurish bricolage than thorough renovation (laminate simply laid over the old fitted carpet, holes in the walls for extra cabling).
When reported to the counter, the friendliness of the staff quickly deteriorated. A cleaning lady was sent on the spot who apparently lacked a special product (= Antical). Unfortunately she was only in possession of a spray with Javel but would certainly report this to the 'Manager'. A good morning from the staff turned out to be no longer an option. However, the hotel apparently has a rather high reputation when it comes to friendliness of the staff.
Despite the multiple positive scores for breakfast, this was also a disappointment.
A very classic and standard breakfast was offered 'corona proof', but if you wanted a glass of cava, each guest had to take the same bottles to pour themselves during covid. Moreover, the waiter on duty didn't speak the Dutch language. The dining room turned out not to be cleaned either, dust and food remains of previous guests were easily spotted.
This is the first time in 20 years that I am writing a review. However, I have never had such a negative experience (not even in countries where the stars are awarded 'smoother').
Any self-respecting 4* hotel would notice these things for themselves and take action here.

Acceptable restaurant.",7.9,4.2,"Upon arrival at the room after check-in, the air conditioning did not work, the wifi either and the small existing refrigerator did not either. I mentioned it to the reception but they could not give any solution, I had to use a personal network cable to connect to a wall socket and thus be able to have internet. Towards an unbearable heat and with the air conditioning not working could not be in the room, for which I had to open the balcony doors throughout the night, resulting in the entry of mosquitoes that ""fried"" me to bites all the night. I do not find it acceptable, that having booked a suite, upon arrival there will not work main services such as air conditioning and wifi. These things should be checked before offering the room in web portals. The direction of the hotel the first night remained totally passive, and did not react until the next day. To my understanding too late. Any excuse then does not solve anything.,

Friendly staff, but not too resolutive facing incidents. The existing restaurant has a varied menu of elaborate dishes. Existence of a park in the facilities, although yes, to get to it has to go through a door and a fairly narrow corridor, be careful with it.",Solo traveller,Stayed 2 nights,1199,299,15,198

This B&B is clearly a labour of love. Sharon is a top-notch host, and one of the sweetest, most caring and sincere owners of a B&B we have met. The exceptionally well maintained and attention is paid to every detail for your experience.   The location, about an 8 min cycle into historical Diest is perfect if you are travelling by bike. There is also a great little grocery store a few minutes walk away if you need any provisions. Water, tea, coffee, milk (for your tea or coffee) and beer are all available for you in the kitchen and Sharon asks you to make yourself at home. There were even chocolates on the bed when we arrived in our room.  The only downside is that there is a shared bathroom, not an issue during our visit since we were the only guests that night but not something we noticed when we booked and something that we usually avoid. Sharon has gone to efforts to make this work with robes in each room for guests transiting to and from the facilities, an ‘in use or available’ sign on the door and space for storage of toiletries etc assigned for each room in the bathroom.Breakfast was excellent with the same attention paid to detail as in all other aspects of our stay.",Couple,Stayed 1 night,1411,511,96,405

474,Exceptional,8.7,10,"Everything was perfect but if I really have to mention something, I would say the absence of a kettle, tea/infusion bags and cups with grip, as well as the fact that the fridge was empty. Indeed, when I arrived at the hotel I had to work straight away and then I attended an evening course online. Eventually, I did not have time to order any dinner from the list I received and, when I went out to look for restaurants, the majority was already closed and the ones I called did not deliver anymore at that time. So I did not have any dinner at all 😅. Fortunately, I had at least water with me. If in the fridge there had been some snacks, it would have been perfect. Furthermore, as to the absence of a kettle, it is true that a microwave is available in a common room, which was very close to mine. I also used it but I have to say that it was not always so practical. The first night I did not have any cups, so I used two glasses instead, but they burned, so I had to use some tissues to protect my hands😅. The second night I kept a cup from the breakfast but still it burned, as the cup did not have any grip😅. The third night I kept even the charcuterie tray from the breakfast and, like this, it was perfect 👌🏻, so easy to move the hot cup from the common room to my room. In any case, it was not a big inconvenience, I just had to adapt a bit. 
Furthermore, I think that kettles are present in other types of rooms (superior).,

I liked everything. The staff was so kind. They offered me a bigger room for the same price as the smaller. They gave me a list of open restaurants which offered delivery and take-away options - really useful, it would be much difficult to find a place to have lunch or dinner without this list. Moreover, the receptionists were able to face and solve a problem (by mistake, I had booked one night less than I needed) with kindness and professionalism and accommodated my requests and needs.
The position is wonderful, located in one of the main shopping streets of Blankenberge, only a few minutes by foot both from the railway station and from the seafront. Very close to the public library and to the Villa Belle Époque.
The breakfast was gargantuan! So rich, good and varied: both savory (charcuterie, salmon, different types of cheese, eggs, tomatoes) and sweet (viennoiserie, different types of jam, Nutella, lotus, yogurt), chocolate or coffee, butter, milk, fresh orange juice, different types of bread. In this period of pandemic, breakfast was served individually in each room.
My room, even though small, was cozy, confortable and clean. The only thing I would have appreciated might be a kettle with some tea bags and some snacks/drinks in the fridge. The toilet had a confortable shower stall.
The hotel is also equipped with a sauna, hammam and jacuzzi, which I tried one afternoon. You have to book it at the reception. I paid eur 40 and for two hours I had it all for me. Hammam was one of the best ever tried, with different and user-friendly functionalities, such as music which changed depending on the programme chosen (relax, purify), chromoterapy, but what I really adored was the scented rain❤️. Sauna was perfect. Jacuzzi was a coup de cœur as for the hammam. So relaxing! I appreciated that I was provided with everything I needed, such as different towels, a bathrobe and a blanket for the relaxing phase.",Single Room,Submitted via mobile,1482,582,22,474

We booked the property because of the light - the images show light coming into those windows. But the owners REFUSED to open the shutters! 
This property is built to the side of the owners' house. They refused to open the shutters for 'privacy'. Don't rent out a house in your garden if you want privacy! (We live in a city and don't care about privacy; we wanted light.)
Also terrible were the kitchen, which had lots of cutlery and crockery but lacked basic cooking utensils or space to put away food, and the downstairs toilet and/or bar drains, which stank.,

I would write a novel on what we liked if you want!
Catherine is a lovely host who has it all.
Right from welcoming to planning our best spots in Brugges ( she taught us to pronounce it as BBrrrrugheee)
Spotlessly clean rooms and you have the lower floors with a dining and living space (not to forget the garden) done in a classical style.
Nice old music playing from Beatles to Bob
Map with a great explanation of what to and what not to do in the short time we had
Good suggestions for chocolate places, restaurants
This place knows what they are doing 
They are into real hospitality which has been lost along by so many hosts.
She was like a Mother hen taking care of our every single need to the extend that she even booked us a taxi to the train early in the morning 
This has made us thinking already of going back to Brugges again
Breakfast- homely, top quality and enough quantity.

The other bathroom has a tub with shower hose (not fixed to the wall), a sink and mirror. We had no issues with sharing the bathroom with the other guests, it was not a problem at all. However, I still didn't notice it was shared when booking. We were in the ""Double Room"" which does not match the photos on Booking, The Double Room has a small seating area, and narrow stairs up to a loft where the bed is.  She did provide a small lamp on both levels. We left the downstairs lamp on at night so that we could see going up and down the stairs to get to the bathroom.,

Maria was an absolutely amazing host! We were originally supposed to arrive at 10pm, and she was more than willing to accommodate us. We showed up earlier than expected, at 5pm, and she was there waiting to let us in. This is a small B&B and Maria lives at the property. This is not a hotel with a 24/7 front desk and staff, so I was grateful Maria was there, although she wasn't expecting us until later. Upon arrival Maria was so welcoming. We sat at her table while she pulled out a map and made recommendations for places to visit, sight-see and eat. It was great to have some local knowledge, and although we had been to Brugge before she recommended places we had no previously been. After welcoming us she showed us around the B&B. It was very clean! We didn't see any bugs at all (let alone bed bugs as other reviews mention). Maria provided extra blankets in case we got cold. She had us inspect the bathrooms and bedroom to make sure it was to our liking. The WiFi was good and we were able to stream Netflix no problem. The parking is 10EUR a day, but its in her personal garage right next to the property. It fit my large SUV no problem, and the neighborhood and parking was very safe and secure. Every morning we were provided an excellent breakfast of fresh bread, homemade jam that Maria makes herself, cheese, salami and omelettes made to order. Tea and coffee are included. She offers fresh orange juice for 4EUR a glass, but neither my husband or I are juice drinkers so we declined with no problems or pressure. The location is amazing and about a 5 minute walk from De Halve Man Brewery.

The price I had been quoted for our upgraded room was exceeded in the final bill and the receptionist refused to change it.There is no bar in the hotel except during the limited hours that the restaurant is open. You can buy cold drinks at reception, but coming back on a very wet afternoon there was no possibility of obtaining a hot drink which I think there should have been. Do as we did and take a travel kettle and supplies.Cleanliness: In the breakfast area of the dining room there was a pedal bin which had not been emptied for at least two days and which had fruit flies multiplying inside it.Safety: the wooden flooring of the balcony was extremely slippery when wet as it had not been cleared of algae.This could, and should be a lovely hotel, but these things spoiled it.,

Restaurant located in the basement, it feels dark & filthy in there. I was charged circa 10% extra to the booking.com rate as explained by hotel it's due to currency difference. Room prices are set in USD, whilst normally you expected to pay in local currency. This reminds me of the era right after  Soviet Union collapsed. When everything in CIS countries was traded and sold in USD. Not much has changed in Belarus since that time, it's still stuck in post Soviet times.Soap is limited  to 2 portions per person. I would be keen to learn, how are you suppose to shower and wash you hands throughout the day with that amount?Window's  sound insulation on the top floor is terrible, can hear motorway all night long.,

I do realise I did not read the small print in depth as ""room only comes with bottles of water (these were v small). The room came with a large fridge though but I had no use for it as you were told you cannot eat in the room. My main concern was one night I came down to the ground floor for a cup and on returning to my room my electronic key card would not allow me back in my room. There was no staff to help me in reception. My mobile phone was in my room! Hotel guests also could not help. There was a notice on reception table to ring a number. I used the phone in reception (I had no other) I kept getting answer service. It was now 23.00 at night, now I was very tired thinking I will have to spend all night on sofa in reception. I am an older traveler. If I had poor health problem, ? Needed urgent medical treatment (? Where is the defibrillator position) or a grandchild locked in my room what could I do. Eventually a member of the staff, a young lady from somewhere in the hotel came down. She was angry with me for using the reception phone and kept saying I should use my mobile which was in my locked room. She said to me they never had this problem before!!! She was blaming me causing it. Eventually she changed my room card and I could enter my room. Nearly midnight and exhausted. This is not acceptable for a hotel guest to be treated like this. In the morning I told the day staff what had happened and the girl said it should not be like that. I was offered nothing for my inconvenience. 
I must also add the duvets the hotel uses have all separated inside so that is why the hotel must keep them in a roll! I had an old stain spot on my sheet. Also there was only a mattress cover on the mattress topper. Would I use or recommend this hotel again? Probably not. ,

1293,Comfortable stay including many amenities,8.5,7.9,"This is a huge hotel, which meant that the elevators and breakfast room were always quite busy and crammed. The building is also a bit old and didn't look like it had been renovated recently-there was also a weird, musty smell around the corridors, at least on the third floor. There are predominantly dark colors, such as deep purple, on the walls and carpets (since there are pictures of actors everywhere, perhaps to resemble a movie theater as a theme?), which makes the inside look a bit gloomy at times. We asked a member of the staff how much a taxi ride to the airport would cost and were told 20-25 euros depending on traffic, whereas the next day, another member of the staff told us it would cost 40-45 euros (it eventually cost 49 euros). Even though these are not major problems, we might choose a more southern point in the city for any future visits, as the area around Marivaux seemed a bit less lively and somewhat rundown (however this is clearly a matter of personal preference).,

We were pleasantly surprised to find how spacious the room was! We also really liked the bed mattresses, which were exactly as firm as they need to be after walking around all day. The room had most probably been renovated and was quite clean. It also came with many amenities such as an espresso machine and espresso capsules, slippers, notepad and pencil, safe, refrigerator, and hangers, all of which were really useful. We particularly appreciated the small, complimentary bottles of water. The desk and closets were also rather big and convenient and there was more than enough room for our luggage. The bathroom was also spacious, with a separate bathtub plus a corner shower in one room and a toilet in a different room. The staff were always very polite and friendly, we couldn't open the refrigerator upon arrival and they fixed it the next morning. Last but not least, the hotel is right next to a subway stop (Rogier) and roughly 12 minutes away from Grand Place on foot.",Couple,Stayed 2 nights,2406,1506,41,1293

The breakfast was superb - every morning Christine suprised us with little extras or fresh fruits. Our spacious room was most tastefully decorated - the perfect place to come home to after long walks through medieval Bruges. Our dog was warmly welcomend too and enjoyed the surrounding countryside as a nice contrast to the crowded city. In the morning Christine gave us superb insider tips for must-do's and nice places in Bruges and the ""Ommeland"". She also told us where to park our car when we went to Bruges. Since there are several parking areas with low or no fees at all, staying outside of the town isn't really a disadvantage.From the first moment on we felt that everything Christine does she does with love. We highly recommend this charming place and will certainly return to her fabulous hide-away!",Leisure trip,Queen Room with Garden View,2410,1510,73,1297

Yet, the premise can be disappointing if you want more than that; our room was in an annex behind the owner's house, separated by a tiny non-inspiring courtyard and our view was on the closed screens of the owners house. Nothing romantic/historic/industrial design here. Direct surrounding is just Flemish village style homes. We didn't explore the neighboorhood. Booking promised 35 m2 room, actual room was around 16 m2, no minibar.,

We stayed for 1 night. We were hiking in the Hoge Kempen and this place (at 20 car minutes) was the only reasonably priced hotel we could find.

I can see why the hotel is busy because there is nowhere else to go apart from a couple of restaurant/bars which I was told were very good and a small local bar which was very quiet.Also make sure you research taxi services if that is what you require because I couldn't get one from Neerpelt station as I was told there are very few taxis as they aren't required! All in all I found it a very strange place but quite endearing,as I said I can't fault the hotel in any way so if you are requiring a good quality hotel at reasonable prices I would highly recommend it but don't expect anything else from the area,I was working and as my long searched for taxi driver said there is nothing here to see !,

Excellent hotel could not fault anything.paid €315 for 3 nights excellent value for money.I ate in the restaurant on the first night and it was lovely food with a nice cosy atmosphere,it has obviously got a good reputation for food as it was busy with non hotel guests all eating.The breakfast was very good with a wide selection of options from bacon,eggs,different breads and plenty of pastries..I stayed 2 weeks before Christmas and the decorations were lovely in the hotel.I cannot fault anything about the hotel so if you are visiting the area I would hesitate to recommend this hotel.",Solo traveller,Stayed 3 nights,2643,1743,74,1497

Spacious, spotlessly clean room with an amazingly comfortable bed. All staff we met were lovely, especially room service and bar staff (ask Pierre to make you a cocktail!). Room cleaning seemed a little bit inconsistent, but I think that's because different people service the room at different times of the day i.e replace towels and make the bed at one point, replace items at another.

The location is probably the best in Bruges. Our room was EUR 150 and we had a beautiful view. Breakfast was painful however. Despite Corona rules everyone arrived at breakfast at the same time and one member of staff was ‘policing’ all the food. She was borderline rude and disorganised but you could tell that she thought that she was doing a great job. The food itself was very uninspired, but that is typical of Bruges. From a culinary point of view, Bruges is pathetic. still serving the same crap as in the 70s, 80s, 90s.... The town however is so delightful that most of the time one doesn’t really care.

We wondered why they gave us the uncomfortable bed, whereas the other bed felt very comfortable with nice sheets and good pillows, but after closing the windows for a while we found out it was because of the horrible sewer smell.The bedroom was connected to the staircase of the owners with a wooden door and was above some kind of bar/livingroom where the owners were entertaing some guest till 1am and were running up and down the stairs which made it even harder to sleep.The room didn't seem very clean. We found an open can in the fridge and clothes in the drawers.The television didn't work. Curtains in the bathroom would have been nice.,

Plants and climbers are growing around the perimeter of the courtyard and it was a relaxing place to sit with the sun reaching into the area.The street outside is narrow (requires parking on the pavement to unload the car) and safe, free on-street car parking is a short walk away.

He takes incredibly good care to make sure that you are comfortable and has your needs met, while also going above and beyond making sure that hygiene and health standards are kept during these Covid-19 times for the health and safety of everyone staying there.The rooms were spotlessly clean, incredibly comfortable, and the location is perfect - short walking distance to the city centre and many other points of interest, while also quiet enough for a good nights sleep. Public parking is also conveniently located across the street, which was great for us since we travelled by car.If you're looking for a clean, comfortable, hospitable stay while in Brussels I couldn't recommend Art de Sejour enough",Couple,Stayed 1 night,3084,2184,53,1844

We were pretty much ignored, had to ask twice for everything and wait for everything. After 1.5 hours at the table, we had received only our starter. We gave up and asked for the bill. No apology, no questions, the bill was plonked wordlessly on our table. Rarely have we experienced such poor service. The problem I believe, lay with the restaurant manager who did not manage her staff.We complained to the manager at the time (she was dismissive about the whole business and said we hadn't been waiting long!).We complained the next morning to the reception staff and they were excellent, accepted the complaint, took notes and refunded the meal cost (which was not the reason for my complaint).Maybe we were just unlucky, but it shouldn't happen in a quality hotel.,

1933,Lovely hotel & adorable staff,8.2,8,"What I did not liked:
Pretty much the morning front desk staff « Jean » if that is even his real name. His behavior is really uncomfortable from the check in to the check out! He has one word on repeat « I will charge you » for pretty much every sentences he said. I’m a paying costumer I did not ask anything for free. I have never heard this word so much without even asking for anything. Fast forward at breakfast I went downstairs with my robe and slippers. He stopped me got up and said in a mean way “where are you going like that”? I replied breakfast? Oh no you cannot go to breakfast like that and better take it in your room. Then at check out he called my suite 5 minutes before the agreed check out time to press me out in a really stressed way (mind you I was packed with no intention of staying). When I asked for help for my luggages he said he had no one and did not proposed to help. In the suites there is no elevator only stairs so I said well i can’t bring them down only then he proposed to help. Not sure what is the deal with this man but that is not my problem. Like I said I’m a costumer, I’m extremely polite, quiet and respectful of everyone. I will not condemn anyone behaving this way with me no matter what the issue is with him he should not bring that to work and give a bad experience to innocent costumers who choose to stay at hotel Manos and happen to be there during his shift. I loved the hotel, I will come back but hopefully he is coached by then! ,

What I liked:
I booked a suite lovely and charming deco. I wish there was another ac unit in the living room but I managed to use the one in the bedroom to cool down the entire suite. Loved that there was even a piano.

Mario was amazing and helpful and you can see a lot of thought has gone into the place and set up. His helpful tips of where to go and what to see were also really helpful as we were only there for one day/night before moving on. Communication from booking onwards was great and responsive.

So, it’s just that it wasn’t cleaned properly at some time and the limescale got built at the parts if the tap that are harder to reach. That is what they need to improve.

1982,Love every moment of our stay here!,9.8,10,"We absolutely loved our stay here last week!! Better than all the 4-star hotels I've had! Thank you so much, Mario!
Location: it's very conveniently close to Grand Place, Mannekin Pis, the Christmas markets, shops, museums, metro, and Eurostar station. The area also felt safe and quiet so sometimes we end up going out for a walk until the late at night.
Room: very spacious and elegant room. Very well lit and decorated nicely. The ceiling was really high. Our bed was very comfortable and the room has blackout curtains so we ended up sleeping like a baby for more than 8 hours!! The bed linens and pillows smelled very nice and fresh! Our room had a computer (Mac) so we were able to use it to browse the internet during the evening. Wi-Fi in the room was very fast. There was a coffee machine and tea bags provided and milk is also available in the fridge. Our fridge had soft drinks and water available too. I really liked the chocolates (Amande) and biscuits (Speculoos) that were provided next to the coffee machine. In the shower room/toilet, they provided L'occitane products which was a very nice touch. Again, the towels and bathrobes provided were clean and fresh-smelling. Toilet and sink are very clean and pristine condition. The waterfall shower felt very nice and relaxing!
Breakfast: we looked forward to our breakfast every morning! The breakfast room is always so clean and the ambience is relaxing. The seats are very comfy and the plates and cutlery are also very nice and clean too! Mario (the owner) would make us smoothie shots first thing, which was very fun and refreshing. After which, you can choose to have fruit salad or go straight to hot food. My fiancé would always have the fruit salad first and he said they were sweet and fresh and non-slimy! As you can see from the picture, the croissant and bread are provided with butter and different jams. You can choose to have eggs and Mario will cook them to your preference.",Couple,Stayed 3 nights,3271,2371,4,1982
1983,"Beautiful view, nice staff, good breakfast, good location, would definitely stay again.",8.4,9,"A general dearth of plug sockets-one on only one side of the bed, one at an awkward waist-height location with no table nearby, and one in the bathroom. The bathroom also had a see-through door. It was blurry glass, so you couldn't see everything, but it's more than clear enough to see the general shape of your partner sitting on the throne on his ipad. Not to mention, the sound is clear enough to hear through clearly. Kills the romantic vibe somewhat! The coffee tasted like instant, and while the room itself was beautiful, the ground floor hallway looks very scruffy and needs a refurb. I requested a certain room well ahead of time for the cosy aesthetic and the beautiful canal view, and although the staff were able to give it to us, they were unable to confirm it until the day of arrival. As the rooms were not ridiculously expensive but definitely not cheap, I would have been very annoyed to turn up and find out I couldn't have the room and that I had to pay over the odds for a generic-looking hotel room when I could have gone elsewhere for cheaper.,

I requested the ground floor ahead of time and the staff were kind enough to give it to us. The view over the canal, bridges and architecture from this room is beautiful-we did not know until we did a walking tour but the hotel used in the film In Bruges is next door, so the canal we could see from the window was the same canal Colin Farrell jumped into. There are frequently swans and ducks floating about under the window, which was nice. The room was toasty warm at all times even when it was freezing outside, which is great for a basement/ground floor, very clean, the shower was good and there was also a bathtub. There was a lot of lighting in the room-over each side of the bed, the whole bed, the whole room, the table area, the sofa-so you can pick whether you want romantic lighting, reading lights, general light, etc. The bed was huge, and very comfortable. My partner who is a bad sleeper found it excellent for sleeping undisturbed by my moving about or my (alleged) snoring. There is also a sofa which converts to another bed, a small table with two chairs, and another smaller sofa built in to an alcove. Despite all this, there is plenty of floor space because the room is pretty massive. The breakfast was pretty good and varied. There are some lovely bars and squares nearby if you exit and head away from the main square, as well as a good bottle shop, lots of chocolate shops, the torture museum, pretty bridges and a hotel bar (though we didn't go in, it looked good).

2014,Passable,9.1,5,"- No shower
- Not suitable for elderly or disabled people
- Not suitable for small children
- Not suitable for people with astma or other longdiseases
- Really small garden which is more smaller than you think because of the fact the owner uses the most part of the garden for own use. Further the garden is full of rocks and therefore not suitable for children. No children playingparts or BBQ in the garden
-Kitchen sink and cookingpart not clean
- Garden roof is full of birdpoop
- No heater only charcoal of which there is no drain! The owner has made a simple drain to the bedrooms upstairs instead a drain outside the home that the smell will go outside the home. So bad for your health! Home is not ventilated and therefore in the morning your mouth smells like tar
- No modern stuff like USB drive, XBox etc.
- No large mirror downstairs in the bathroom or outside the bathroom where the wasmachine is
- House really not regarding environment and health rules
- No nice view. In the garden you only see other houses and from the living room you see the street and other homes
- Area nothing to do, no shops, no baker, no supermarket etc.No bank, no ATM. If something happens there is nobody in the area you can go to/ can help you
- No trafficlights and bad roads so if you come in the dark to the home it is dangerous
- Animals allowed

Smoking in the hotel tends to be a problem– someone does it on regular basis (I've noticed it on more than one occasion during several stays), and then the stink invades even to the above mentioned upper floor (perhaps through the canalisation as it is most noticeable in the bathroom)... disgusting. Also, I've stayed in various rooms, and every one has had an annoying flaw, a different one in each occasion. This time it was toilet that would not stop flushing.,

The hotel is well placed if you have business around Schuman and like to take the airport bus. The room is big, kept perfectly clean, has many useful amenities such as microwave, plates, tea kettle. On the plus side, they provide free toiletries during the stay, but keep only providing one packet of tea on the first day only no matter how long you stay (which used to be the case also with the toiletries, so hurray for the progress!).

It had been totally gutted and remodeled and was opened only a year ago and in perfect location. Simple gorgeous throughout.  Rooms lacked for nothing! High end touches, like toiletries provided, bedding, king size beds in all rooms,. Rooms are large and it is more like a condo,you have a separate bedroom, then walk through a large hallway with  closet with tons on space for storage, coffee and tea maker, refrigerator  which provided  free sodas and water bottles, bowls of high end chocolates and cookies. The bathroom is very roomy, with a large walk in shower, lots of space to put your toiletries. A bathrobe is provided and the towels are changed daily and are again high end. There are only 5 rentals and only one rental per floor on the 2,3,4 and 2 rooms on floor 1.  The rooms are quiet, you do not hear outside traffic or any noise from your rental above. The breakfast provided was delicious and you were given a choice of what you wanted to eat.  Eggs, meat, cheese, granola, greek yogurt, fruit and berries, Belgium waffles, assorted breads and croissants, smoothies. Because it is a very small BNB, there is no buffet. The owner was exceptional. He asked our plans for sightseeing and recommended a local guide that his previous guests had used and were so pleased with. The guide was very reasonable, 12 Euros pp for a 2 hour walking tour. We loved the guide and tour! The owner provided us with a list of nearby restaurants that were very reasonable and great food. We only ate from those restaurants and found them to be not only excellent but the portions were so large we split meals! We had problems finding a van for going to the airport at 4 am. He called a company for us that he knew was reliable and ordered the van! He even got up at 4 am to make sure the van arrived and gave us a sack breakfast. His customer service and the BNB went way beyond anything we have ever encountered in Europe.",Group,Stayed 3 nights,3851,2951,86,2398

The door from the street to the building is broken therefore people from the street and nearby night club can enter the common stairwell (and do, at all hours of the night). The music and crowd from the night club close by makes sleep impossible. The sensor lights within the apartment come on and off all night without reason. It is non-smoking accommodation; however the smoke smells from the restaurant and apartment below enter via the bathroom pipes and permeate the apartments above (particularly apartment 2). People in our group woke up feeling ill from this - we had asthmatic children in our group - even the non-asthmatics were affected by the sickly odour. This was our worst Booking.com experience. We all decided it was not worth compromising safety, security and health staying the second night so we checked out first thing the next morning and found alternative accommodation. What a disgrace that this standard of accommodation is acceptable on booking.com.",Group,Stayed 2 nights,3914,3014,4,2433

Got a Junior Suite which was spacious with a courtyard view, bedroom separate from bathroom and a mini hallway area,Although it was very disappointing that a second bed wasn't placed in a lounge area as we were staying with my son, we had to share the bedroom with him, and in my opinion and experience in a suite their should be two sleeping areas. I also thought the bed whilst quite comfortable were tiny, my wife and I shared a supposed double bed and we barely fit it.Also because staying with my son, it would have been nice to take advantage of room service, but the price was ludicrous, starting at 6 Euro for a espresso, so this was completely prohibitive, also be aware the hotel lists spa and fitness centre, whilst a basic gym is available the Spa actually doesnt belong to the hotel and you have to pay a 25 Euro surcharge per day to access it.,

Parking close by, has to be reserved in advance, but at only €10 per day again very reasonable compared with other car parks. A heads up. If you arrive at the car park and the barrier at the top of the ramp is down, punch in the numbers on the ticket given to you by the hotel into the key pad. This will lift barrier to let you down ramp to 2nd barrier where you can insert the ticket and gain entry.

Very limited space for clothes for 2 people, no information about Bruges in the room and even the pieces of soap were tiny.

Everything in the rooms, furniture, towels, looks old, there was no fridge. The breakfast was also disappointing: the choice was very poor, the quality of food is not perfect either.

We only had the desk and its one chair, which kind of brought our breakfast enjoyment down a bit (the pandemic rules require that guests eat only in their rooms).

Great small hotel in a suite of very old buildings.  Unique, wonderful architecture, winding hallways and staircases that led to our gigantic family room with a view over a courtyard to fascinating rooflines and a tower!  The hotel was just off the Grand Market, so it had a great location.  There was a city parking garage nearby, which worked for us since we drove.

2889,"Cozy, Wooden Cabin on Quiet Farmland.",9.1,9,"Two Items for Improvement1.) The cabins are set on ""Pet Friendly"". This is taken to mean by the guests that the pets are welcome in the accommodation. We were not sure the host understood this. He stated that pets should sleep in the car. The temperature was -1 C out so that was not an option. If they are uncomfortable with pets or are unhappy with the state of the cabins after a pet stay they should change this setting to indicate ""No Pets"". 2.) The owner wants 100Euro deposit (IN CASH) on arrival. This is understandable and we had no problem. However they owner should say this very clearly in the advertisement up front. Now it is buried in the ""policies"" which many do not read. Many people are not in the habit of traveling with that much cash these days and they might be cut short. We only knew because we asked about the check in procedures and he mentioned it in passing. Otherwise we would not have known.,

The farm is quiet and peaceful set outside of town. The cabins are new, very clean and very comfortable. I would recommend that they are ideal for no more than two persons especially during bad weather.  The host was very friendly and check in was quick and easy. The breakfast was very nice and taken in our cabin. All was provided beforehand in the refrigerator and cupboard. Many of the ingredients were home made and were very very nice.

Pillow was too dense and high for my taste - would be great to have a selection as in the room there are extra pillows anyway. A blanket is to warm for me, but I have this issue almost everywhere - growing up behind a polar circuit doesn't help me in this case. Bed cover is that half-synthetic thing with a rubber around mattress, doesn't breath really well, but people there are very used to them, so you'll see them a lot. Room is right under the roof and it could be quite hot inside on a sunny days and small windows won't allow to move this hot air out fast. Overall it all may look small to you and you won't even notice, I believe I've just spoiled myself sleeping on fresh chill air in all-natural bedroom at home, that is why I was too shy to tell Els and Tom all that personally.,

Exceptional breakfast, nice owners, perfect location to work in Bornem. Fast WiFi (~20 Mbps) by local standards, although signal strength could be improved.

3059,Pleasant long week-end in Gent,8.9,9.2,"Few negatives. It is truly too bad that the window sound insulation was not properly taken care of when refurbishing/restauring the appartments. Unfortunately street noise can be well heard. Cars passing (although traffic is limited) and poeple speaking in the street especially late partying people on weekends etc.. Truly, this would be the best investment in the facility to make it like 10/10. Some additional towel hangers and shelf in the bathroom would be handy.Provide some cleaning items (sponge or brush) to wash and clean after a dinner or breakfast.,

The location is in a rather quieter area with limited traffic. Parking (paying) available on the adjacent square or street parking; public underground parking in the nearby large square (Vrijdagsmarkt) or with the owner's private garage in the same public underground parking (upon request). The city can be explored on foot easily from the location.The appartments are clearly new and with a modern minimalist decoration. Kitchen is sufficient and large enough with a medium size fridge. Appartment holds a coffee machine and a boiler. Tea and coffee & sugar available. Some appartments maybe larger or smaller as they are not exactly identical but still roomy enough for a long stay. Ours (#101) had a reduced but still sufficient bathroom. The appartment on the corner of the building (#103) is larger and very pleasant.

You are in a student area so the odd music or singing is just part of the package. But the wider area to the north is still being developed and Antwerp as a city is going through a major makeover so many key streets and boulevards are closed off for roadworks. It makes traffic a bit of a challenge.,

The atmosphere and lay-out of the house is fantastic. It also offers some original surprises that just makes you smile and like the place even better.

3229,Passable,8.1,5.4,"First of all, - ATTENTION, there are road and sidewalks reparations all around the hotel quarter, no way to find a way to get the hotel. We had to park at about 100 m from the hotel and ask how and where to park a car (there is private parking at 20 m from the hotel (12 euros/day).
Even if it was not a problem to walk 100 meters more, I always prefer to have more honest information as possible.
So first thing first. The information about 70 meters from the seaside is wrong, - you have to walk at least 100 m to Niewportlann, then about 100 m to the seaside, which makes the total distance of about 200 m.
The second point is about the state of the hotel rooms and facilities. You have an impression that nothing was really done at all to keep it in a good state, just some small reparations scamped here and there to hide some defects.
There is no door in the bathroom, just a plastic folding screen with a handle that you have to change (inside, outside) to be able to close/open the so-called ""door"". The shower has just a half-covering screen, so when you take a shower, you have 50% of water drops outside the shower, just on the floor. The bathroom size is just 1.5 sq.m, so for people of more than 1.75m, there is not much place to turn without hurting vs something.
OK, it is a 2-stars hotel, you might say, but.. no, listen there are some limits, IMHO.
As for the isolation, forget about it, you hear steps, coughs, all that produce any sounds ) you hear it. More of that, as there are works to remake sidewalks and roads, you are woken up with the rumble and noise of all the working vehicles starting from 7am! It stops at 5 pm.
The third point about breakfast. I don't know from which planet come people saying that it was exceptional. As for the variety of products, it was just an absolutely normal thing, you will find almost the same (if not better) in no matter which low-cost European hotel. So why were people so excited about it?,

200 m from the seaside. We arrived at 12.40 and we could get our 2 rooms ready to put our luggage even if the check-in was starting from 2pm.",Family with young children,Stayed 1 night,5099,4199,28,3229

3239,"It is very nice place close to Gent, highly recommended :-)",8.7,9.2,"The only notice is that there is no door between living room and bedroom. So if you are traveling with friends keep in mind that there is not private place to sleep in it, in bedroom from the bed you can see the sofa in living room. There is only one door inside and it is the door in the bathroom. But this door is made of opaque glass and unexpectedly it doesn't go right to the ceiling that's why you can hear any noise from the bathroom and toilet.,

The guesthouse is situated on the second floor of the owner's house with separate entrance. The apartment itself is very clear, pretty spacious for 3 people (living room with kitchen in it, bedroom and a bathroom) and has everything to spend nice week-end close to Gent. We spent 2 nights here and felt like we were at home. It looks like on the photos, there are anything you need from microwave to washmashine and drying mashine (by the way, Miele). There is tea and cofee and you can prepare cofee in coffee maker and use dishwasher. If it is cold in the street there is a heater. There is also private parking just in front of the door. It takes only 15 to drive to the center of Gent and 40 minutes to drive to the center of Brugge. The hosts are very nice people, the communication was easy and very friendly. The owner speaks many languages, it was a pleasure to speak with him in English, German, French. His wife also speaks Russian. We arrived at evening and could enter in the apartment without waiting for long check-in. The ownes came later to welcome us by themselves and to explain us everything. At check-out time we could just close the door by ourselves and it wasn't nessessary to wait somebody.",Group,Stayed 2 nights,5113,4213,14,3239

For a hotel in the middle of the woods, where your boots will unavoidably get dirty, this is far from ideal. The beds were also subpar, especially the small pillows and the sofa bed if you get a room for 4 guests. The food in the restaurant is good, but comes in small portions and is just too expensive for what you get.,

No bikes for teen-agers (only adults and children size). Would like a bit more control in the wellness area/pool, since we spotted some guests not respecting Covid-19 protocols sometimes.,

Very good structure in the middle of Forêt de Soignes and close to the Solvay Castle. The perfect starting point for bike rides and trekking. We appreciated the several free services (including bike renting) and the kindness of all staff members. The wellness area and pool are good and clean, although quite undersized considering how big the hotel is, but they limited to 30ppl per hour (under Covid-19 restrictions, don't know about it in normal circumstances).

Breakfast is served in-room and it's sufficient in quality and variety, although we had missing items all times and had to double ask waiters. The rental bike service, very important for us given the location in full forest, is barely sufficient as bikes are crap. I'd suggest a complete renewal of all equipment. Given the above, pricing is perhaps too high (executive room).,

But the hostel is really big so I guess to feed everyone it's out of budget. But one thing that really brought this one down were the showers. The steam was so small and so weak it was almost impossible to take a proper shower what you would like after a long trip or after a long day out. It was kinda challenging to clean myself for I am big. But that's it, nothing more,

We were lucky enough to catch some Brazilian guys playing whole evening their guitars and singing for us so the atmosphere was absolutly amazing. We had a dance with my girlfriend and it was absolutly amazing. They have good beers on the tap and overal experience was really relaxing. They also have a pool football so it was great fun as well.

He came back with conditioner...There is a minibar in the room, but it's empty. Here too a sign that encourages us to inspire them...The quality of the food in Restaurant Argan is disappointing and overpriced. A glass of wine for €9 but nothing special. These are prices of a high end hotel in Amsterdam.At the bar time has stood still. While the entire hotel's design is unwelcoming, the bar looks like East Germany during communism.I am a tall person, just under 2 meters.

At 20:30 temperature starts already going down while it should close at 23:00. We paid a lot of money (266€ for one night - basic room). this is not the quality you expect for a 266€/night hotel.  the food in the restaurant is also not top. They make mistakes with tables, they forget a part of our order even. Don't take the desserts, its a trap and too low quality for this kind of hotel. nearly not eatable.

3891,Disappointing,8.4,4.2,"Left the hotel 5 hrs after arrival...
Chapter1: we wanted to have a weekend bbq outside of Brussels during nice weather. The facilities of the property showed bbq option, so it looked like a perfect place for it. During check-in I asked receptionist how can we use those. He answered that he has no clue and we will be called to the room. After 30 min waiting no call followed and we went for a walk, seeing receptionist leaving the building pretending not recognizing us.
Chapter2: i called the reception, explained the situation and now the lady told me she has no clue either, and someone will call in 30 min, as they have too much work to do checking in people... after 1 hr waiting no call followed, so we decided to check the pool. 
Chapter 3: there were no towels available in dressing room, so it took me 20 min to find any living person to ask for them, which also took quite some time to bring after.
Chapter 4: lobby bar tables were not cleaned, as a wine list barmen proposed “french” or “argentinian”,  which was also bad wine btw, so we decided to leave
Chapter 5. Departure. I asked for checkout at 8 pm and explained we never got any info on bbq and other issues. The manager kindly explained me that 1) they do not have bbq facilities since a long time 2) its not a problem of Dolce what is written on Booking.com in the list 3) no reimbursement is possible, even the one of extra payment for the dog which we made during check-in. Here, to be objective he proposed free breakfast as compensation, but we really did not want to stay anymore
Conclusion: if you are not a group of 100 people to occupy conference hall, the property (which is 4 star hotel btw) does NOT care about customers... anyhow it’s forest (which is the only nice part there), so nowhere to run...

This is in regards to my stay at CityHome Antwerp June 24 - 26, 2019Dear Hong, I wanted to send you a note of appreciation. First of all, I was impressed with your helpfulness and kindness upon my arrival, and with the way you made sure everything was just right. I also appreciated your taking the time to discuss some of Antwerp's attractions with me.I greatly enjoyed my stay in Antwerp, and your lovely CityHome apartment had a lot to do with that. I could hardly believe how well-appointed it was! All the amenities and utensils were there, far more complete than in a regular hotel room. I was quite impressed how well everything worked, including the many kitchen gadgets and, particularly, the warm (and hot!) water supply in the kitchen as well as in the perfectly designed shower. Such a delightful and comfy place all around... Many thanks!Martin Werner",Solo traveller,Stayed 2 nights,6358,5458,21,3965

We ""did"" France and finished our trip in Ypres, on the way to the ferry. As we planned to attend the Last Post Ceremony I chose it as it was centrally-located. Another great choice! It was easy to get to - it's on a sort of inner ring route, with free on-street parking right opposite the hotel. My daughters had an upstairs room with balcony. This overlooked the garden and was very relaxing. The owners welcomed us in a most friendly way and made sure we were happy with the facilities. The bedrooms were bright, airy, each with its own bathroom and a comfortable double bed. The bathrooms were spacious with a big shower cubicle. It was within 5-10 mins walk of the main centre of Ypres and the Menin Gate, with a wide choice of good restaurants, cafés and bars. The main square in Ypres hosts an excellent market and other events, but was simply a car-park while we were there.Breakfast was really good: a wide choice of fresh croissants and breads, together with cereal, etc. Coffee (or tea if preferred) was plentiful and tasty.The Owners have worked hard to create a comfortable and welcoming place to stay and it shows. The place was spotless. Their advice was happily given on places to visit as well as restaurants/bistros to go to. There is a wide selection of tourist leaflets and booklets on display for visitors to use. It was a shame that we were only there for one night.All in all, I recommend this establishment highly. It is close to the centre, parking is adjacent and free and the town is a great place to wander around with a great choice of eateries (we went to the Ypres Burger restaurant, billed as the finest in Ypres - guess what...it is!).We would certainly come here again, it was a such a nice place to stay.",Family with young children,Stayed 1 night,7318,6418,39,4439

It’s an old hotel made of multiple buildings so we had to go through hallways, out back through a courtyard, then into another building and up some very steep narrow stairs to get to our rooms.,

In fact they gave us the wrong advice about the timings but that was due to a misprint in local paper. We solved’it ourselves with using town edge parking and taxi.
Bit strange that all the cleaners tackle was just dumped in the corridor next to our room when we arrived and room next to us was wide open and it stayed like that all night, as if cleaner had just downed tools and left.,

No problem that we arrived very late evening after attending a wedding, night staff checked us in cheerily.
View of St Rombauds from window - if you looked along side of building.
Modern room though just a bit cheerless - could do with a bit more colour or decoration.
Modern led lighting strips.
Excellent breakfast though it did cost 18€ per person.
Very easy walking distance to Mechelen sights.
Friendly and helpful staff, had a solution for everything - lockable baggage store available after checkout until we wanted to depart. Helpful in calling us a taxi and suggested we use the lounge bar until taxi arrived on our departure.
We have good impressions of our short stay here. Liked the small outdoor areas on each floor. Could be even better used if there was seating on them.",Couple,Stayed 1 night,7408,6508,21,4486

Located literally on the Main Square, the main city attractions are at your immediate disposal. The room was ready before 3 pm (official check in time), we found it very handy. The room was of an adequate size, I need to point out the large, extremely comfortable bed, Nice bathroom with rain shower. large towel selection. Coffee and tea making facility with choice of tea, regular coffee, decaf and cream. The breakfast was included in the room rate and it was the biggest surprise. Let me elaborate, as a frequent traveler for business and leisure, I've accumulated lots of experience BUT such a luxurious breakfast experience I don't remember. Great choice, variety of the items from cheese, ham, various jams, sweet spreads, butter, eggs, bread rolls and various viennoiseries... Quantity wise, it was more than enough for 2 people. Last but not least, very friendly staff ready to help you at any moment.

They cleaned rooms, corridors and everything, every day. The place even smelled good. The lockers in the room were so big, you could fit a human inside. With 3 shelves, 3-meter height, there is nothing you can't fit in. The locker room for storing your bags and suitcases after checking out was also free. No need for padlocks as all lockers has digital lock. Staff were super friendly, fluent in English and so helpful. Good breakfast included with cereals, cheese, bread, peanut butter, chocolate, milk, coffee, juice and oranges and apples. Very big kitchen with lots of kitchen appliances, 3 stoves and spices.

Particularly lovely for couples' romantic atmosphere. :((( the entrance to the studio is upstairs, not protected by any fence so at night it was particularly dangerous to walk up and down the stairs. Despite this, the owner strongly recommended to not let the outside lamp on as the light would have bothered someone on the ground floor; funny thing is that underneath the stairs there was just the owner's bathroom so not sure how the light could have bothered anyone unless she didn't sleep in the bath tub. The real reason was very simple - the owner tries to cut costs of absolutely everything! The second proof of this was no heating in the room, it basically stopped after 5 min of work as a thermostat was apparently set on 15 degrees. It was a cold night and the walls were very thin so I had to go downstairs to ask for a portable heater (was asked to not put it on maximum though). Pillows was very uncomfortable, we were lucky having our own ones with us.There were no toiletries (almost empty dispensers, half roll (!) of toilet paper.Please, don't count on breakfast at this premise! For 2 people we got 2 eggs, butter and lots of bread. My husband asked an orange juice but got an expired peach juice. He could have been easily poisoned. Again, the owner is extremely stingy and try to get max profit from the room booking. And the worst part of this stay is the owner's inappropriate comments. After I gave her place a good rate (despite all issues) she sent me a very rude email, see the prints teen attached.Terrible experience, I strongly recommend to stay away from this studio.",Couple,Stayed 1 night,29396,28496,60,5196

André is really a special person! We have never stayed somewhere with such a kind and thoughtful proprietor. You see this both in the way he is with his guests and in every detail of the property.

This can be a bit of a hinderance if one's coming in late at night.  The local Butcher is open on Sundays, fortunately, and I picked up a steak, various cold cuts and Olives, Antipasto, etc.   Got a bit stuck when unable to cook due to no oil/butter. The owner/hoast brought the butter promptly but since she only speaks French (*very* little English), communication was difficult. On day 2, I used Google translate which was a lot better to communicate.   ANOTHER issue is the funky heater/Fireplace which burns pellets.  The instructions are non-existent and the explanation by the owner is in French.   What she needs to do is create ENGLISH instructions for the fireplace/heater.  Putting it on/off a few times results in heater damage (which is what happened) and the owner gave me a temporary electric heater.  That worked but was not half as charming!!,

Very nice ambience in the Chalet and good views of the surrounding forest.

Just perfect and if you eat all that you dont need lunch till 3pm ! Property - 5 rooms all tastefully done , we were in number 3 right on top perfect for 2 people . It is a narrow staircase , and passageways but like being in a fairy tale home ! I would want one myself  im almost 6 foot tall and i got along just fine ! The whole house is a like a small time capsule of memorabilia from the past , European and otherwise . Dietrich is the big surprise with his phenomenal knowledge of everything in the house and the fascinating world of flea markets and treasures you can find , if youre a history buff you will love this .  We stayed 3 nights and will for sure come back in the Summer . The city of Brugge is time standing still , preserved , fresh and very romantic . Location :  It is only 600m from the main Markt Square and Belfry and 100m from the inner canal.  The reason kids are not allowed is because the place is not built for them , it is best for older teens and above . You need to be calm to enjoy the beauty of this home.

Hostel was clean. I stayed in a 4-bed room and there was a small shower in the room (the door has a gap so it’s not really private, however it’s only a shower) which I personally don’t like much as it only creates more noises if someone showers early/ late.

The WC/shower space taken could have been better configured to provide wardrobe hanging space, of which there was none. On arrival, we were note told the location of the breakfast room, which was not (as we had assumed) the main dining room. At breakfast coffee was served from a machine, causing a queue to form. Its much more convenient if staff serve coffee to the table. That was an unfortunate tendency toward lack of personal attention to guests.,

You can open your bags and arrange your luggage without bothering your roomates. I'm guessing this also minimizes the risk of a guest bringing bed bugs, as their luggage doesn't get in contact with bedding. Breakfast is pretty good too. Staff is nice and since Bruges is pretty small, the location is fine.They have lockers (free of charge) to leave your luggage before or after check in.",Solo traveller,Stayed 1 night,30391,29491,90,5903

In toilets, there were no hangers, no soaps, no mirrors etc. since they are the only private places when you stay in a dorm, you only get frustrated.

I was told that both the maintenance man and the hotel manager had already left for the day (which seems crazy when people book in after 3pm!). The reception guy (who had a definite air of acting like he was better than everyone else) said he’d report it to be fixed the next day. Apparently there were no other rooms available for us to move to. He said he’d change the bulbs that afternoon. 
It was not fixed that day, nor the next. There was no apology and he clearly didn’t care. It was my 50th birthday trip and this spoilt it for me. There was no attempt to compensate for the disappointment.
We also couldn’t open/close one of the curtains (it was stuck half way) so I slept very badly as the light came in in the morning.

6658,"Poor customer service, poor nights sleep.",8.3,4.6,"We arrived at 2.35pm to be told our room wasn’t ready and to come back at 3pm. We very much had the impression that the room was ready and they just have a policy of making you wait until the 3pm check in time. When we got our room it had 5 or 6 flies buzzing round, and the sloping walls were thick with dust and dirt. We went down to ask for a different room, and were asked if we had touched anything in the room. I do wonder if we would have been told we couldn’t change rooms if we had in fact touched something. We were then told that the walls weren’t dirty, it was shadow, despite us saying we had brushed some of it off. The man at reception continued to argue, but nevertheless changed our room. We came down later and the man in reception continued to argue, so asked to speak to the manager. He apologised, and offered us late check out. Later that evening we returned and the receptionist did then apologise, but STILL argued that we were wrong and the room wasn’t dirty! The room was also very noisy, we had a poor nights sleep because of the loud shouting on the street.,

Location was good, very close to the Grand Place. There are lots of restaurants and bars nearby. It’s an easy walk from Bruxelles Centrale station.",Couple,Stayed 1 night,31118,30218,78,1819

6661,Abdullah Alayadhi's Review,8.8,8.3,"One of the biggest things that I dislike is the room service as I call the reception to bring me some items such as a Tissue, Towels, and bathropes, they told me to come down to grap these items as per the hotel's policy (6 points). ,

1- Location :
Nice location, it is really good if you think to be out of the city center a bit and close to a clean area. You can take the Metro to Shuman Stop for about 10 minutes and then 5 minutes walking to the hotel. The hotel also is really close to the European Union Commission (8.5 points).
2- Staff:
Respectful and friendly staff , especially the French gentleman Mr. Eric who assisted us a lot in discovering attractions in Brussels and facilitated how to move around the city (9.5 points).
3- Cleanliness & Quietness:
The room and bathroom are clean; however, the wallpaper has some scratches in some areas. The room and hallways are quiet (7.5 points).
4- Room Size & View :
The size of the rooms are very decent as we got a nice room with a fabulous view across the fountains. (10 points).
5- Amenities:
 The hotel is very modern as the reception desk is located in the middle of the lobby. It also has a nice snack bar with coffee maker. The bar named WXYZ has conformable seats for those who care about drinks or just chatting. Furthermore, the hotel has a nice gym where you can find the most basic machines ""Time Fitness"" and dumbbells. Baer in mind that there is no swimming pool, jacuzzi, steam room, or souna (8 points). 
6- Price:
I have booked this hotel with an affordable price and it's worth staying (9 points). 
7- Service Level:
One of the biggest things that I dislike is the room service as I call the reception to bring me some items such as a Tissue, Towels, and bathropes, they told me to come down to grap all these items as per the hotel's policy (6 points).

6792,"Our stay Sept 3, 2018",8.3,6.7,"We booked this from the USA Looking for a place to stay near the Henri-Chapelle WWII American veterans cemetery. Nobody was there when we arrived. Luckily our taxi cab driver stayed and contacted a person who came. Next, the facility is advertised as having a restaurant, however, because it was the holiday, the restaurant was closed. Luckily again, the person who came Took us to a restaurant several miles away for evening dinner after we visited the cemetery then arranged for a ride to take us back to the place. It all worked out, but started out scary with the taxi driver driving around forever unable to locate the place, and causing us undue stress limiting our precious time at the cemetery.  I took out my map that I had printed from home and noticed he had driven past the street more than once. I told him so. In the end he reduced the taximeter from 65 Euro to 20, the amount we were quoted as needing from the train station. This was not a good experience but by the grace of God turned out. The taxi driver’s wife returned in the morning to pick us up and take us to the train station. In my opinion and according to others, the taxi driver certainly knew where he was to take us and was trying to soak us for more money Unconcerned that we were there to go to the cemetery. Sad how these people think they can get away with that when they see  foreign travelers.  The motel lady said the driver certainly knew where her place was, but if she knew we were coming, why wasn’t she there when we arrived?  This was a bad experience, And only turned out by the grace of God. If we ever return, we won’t be staying there. Do you blame on us?,

With the Snuffel bar being so cheap and popular amongst the locals, you can actually Interact with one or few of the young locals.
Plus you can save some money for booze as it's cheaper to have it at Snuffel.
It's a walking distance to everything you want to see in Brugge, with the laundromat and bus stop to Brugge station just a few metres away from Snuffel. So practical. You get to set your own locker code, so it feels safer. The staff is so friendly and helpful, and they can help u open ur locker in case u forgot ur passcode (it happens haha).

They are re-inventing something or other in a more trendy start-uppish way and it is as comfortable as living in an app. The check-in  area is gloomy and there is a large, dark empty space behind it which make you feel you arrived at a deserted warehouse. The room was not clean (euphemism for stains on the floor), and it was divided to two adjoining sections which made each exactly just a little bit too small. The free WI-Fi does not support apps such as whatsapp or google maps, so it's basically useless. One more thing: if you need a taxi, book your own.  The company they work with proved to be unreliable. Given the option I will not stay in an Aloft hotel again.,

It really seemed like she wasn't experienced, because she didn't mention all the necessary things, but the most outrageous is that when we asked her if the breakfast was included, she said ""Yes"".

There was a gap under the door that wasn't covered by the curtains and all the cold air and noise was slipping in through there. The heater was working as per thermostat settings but since the bunk bed was closed towards the heater, and the gap was right near the bed.. it wasn't enough. Also, due to the huge interesting bunk bed, there was no space in the room.
The water from the bath tap was hot but wouldn't come hotter to make a decent bath. By the time the bath filled the water had cooled due to not being hot enough. Was okay for a shower though, but we were already really cold and needed to warm up and the bedroom wasn't helping us either.. unfortunately whoever designed this room didn't think the space properly because there was so much space down in the bathroom and nice and warm that I'd had rather slept in there than in the cold and tight bunk bed room above.,

The bedroom had an interesting design.. on 2 levels.. with a huge bunk bed as you walk in and the bathroom on the ground level, right under the bed. One can play with the light in the bathroom and makes it even more interesting.

7716,An exceptionally stylish home away from home with just the right amenities,9.2,10,"The main things to consider before booking this boutique hotel are the fairly strict conditions in comparison with larger city centre hotels, in particular a 30-day cancellation policy and little flexibility of the timing of your check-in, as staff is only present at breakfast and during certain hours of the afternoon to receive new guests. The premises are fully covered by CCTV. If you can live with those restrictions, and if you don't mind climbing stairs, then you will have an absolutely wonderful stay.Perhaps a small point of improvement might be the stability of the Wifi connection in the top floor suite, but the network connectivity in the common area was excellent.,

Loved the smell of freshly baked croissants every morning, as well as the overall help-yourself-at-any-time attitude of this boutique hotel, which does indeed make it an ""all in one"" experience. Coming home from work, you can make yourself a coffee or choose from a range of exquisite teas, and there will be some cookies and cake to accompany your beverage, which you enjoy in a beautiful salon with art on the walls and glossy magazines.A special thanks to staff, who noticed within two minutes of my departure that I had forgotten my laptop in the room and took the trouble of reaching me on mobile to ensure I wouldn't leave without it.

It was a very comfortable space to do some coaching work and superb location to Parc Josaphat nearby for some walks with my clients and evening exercise.The house is extremely well equipped and with the changeable weather I used both the log fire and the outdoor garden. It is such a bonus to be able to rent a location where many of the basics are available to use (tea, coffee, oil, salt etc) and have the trams, a Carrefour, bank and Pharmacy very close by. It was made special by the care and attention to detail I received by Sophie on arrival.

We weanted to change the room but were told that the hostel os overbooked. Next morning, frozen as hell we tried to change the room which turned into a joke. First room we were given was cold w/o heating, next one had ppl in it etc... Ths staff was pretty friendly but adamant about no refunds... I tried to argue that there should be a refund if they fail to deliver a basic service... In the end after like 1-2 hrs of hustling we were finally given a room with heating on. There was no heating in the shared bathroom though and the room was sloppily cleaned, but at that point we did not care... Bruegel was far from cheap a price close to a hotel without basic service top back it up. So worst stay ever unfortunately.... I never thought this can happen in an European capital - hostel without heating at winter time....,

It would have been nice to have a washing machine and dryer. If you are short you may find it hard to reach some of the dishes on the shelves.,

A beautiful place to stay. Easy to access with the lock box to enter the house when we arrived as that was a lot easier for us than trying to agree on times as we were travelling and had no mobile phone access in Belgium.  Great not having to carry keys. Lots of room with the bedrooms on 3 floors and 2 bathrooms. Nice setting with the garden, lovely decor and easy walk into town with the car parked close by.  We were travelling with our adult children. Plenty of space for everyone to relax. Everything you needed in the kitchen. We didn't met our host but everything was emailed and no problem communicating this way as we got replies very quickly. Don't forget to print or keep the emailed instructions about how to access the house before you leave home. We would definitely recommend Blossom and Bloom as a place to stay in Bruges.

8096,Advertised facilities not at this property,9.4,6.7,"The property was advertised as having 2 bedrooms and 1 bathroom with a hot tub when in fact there was no bathroom only a shower and sink within the main bedroom. This caused major problems for us as we were a group of 4 adults who all needed the use of the shower and sink which could not happen when the bedroom was in use.
The 2nd bedroom is in the attic this is fine for children but being an adult of 6ft meant every time I got out of bed my head banged into the eaves of the wall. This bedroom did not have a wardrobe this was situated on the 1st floor landing which meant coming up and down stairs when clothes were needed.
The property was advertised as having a balcony with city views and a terrace unfortunately this was again incorrect as there is no balcony at this property and the terrace was tiny and was filled with plant pots you could not sit outside. I feel let down as the advertisement for the property sounded great but without these facilities our stay was not comfortable. ,

The welcome we got when we arrive was lovely.
The property was about a 10 minute walk from the centre. 
The downstairs of the house was lovely a great little kitchen with all you needed for your stay. The sitting area was big enough for 4 adults and was comfortable. 
The use if 2 bikes was a nice touch although we did not use them.

We took a breakfast included and had to give the waitress these special breakfast ""tickets"" each time.4. We were provided Wifi passwords for every device we had. PC in the room(Windows XP!) needed one of those password too. They were valid for 2 days and then we had to ask for another...5.  We had some tiny shampoo sachet - one for a person in the room(it was an ""improved apartment""). I would recommend taking your own shampoo visiting this hotel.,

Lots of trucks were passing by.   The shower + toilette was not properly separated (with little or no ventilation of the bathroom) from the large room (once elegant street facing living room). The drawback of the conversion was there were limited or non-existent common spaces of the hotel. Expect to pay 10 EUR for the parking cash on the arrival.,

It is an OK stay considering it is Bruges and the price. The internet was above expectation: it was super fast and simple to use. The staff was helpful, they spoke English and French (besides the Flamish of course). The overall impression it is  an affordable stay.",Family with young children,Stayed 1 night,33785,32885,92,5479

The apartment is stylish and comfortable, and the kitchen equipment  & tableware are great - the selection of glasses is maybe better than ours at home! We managed to use 1 or 2 of each type, without breaking anything! Our concierge Bavo was always available, and helped us in a friendly manner, including some recommendations of the better local fish traiteurs.The best test of hosts is actually when something goes wrong! In our case, the thermostat in the shower stuck - on MAX!! Impossible  to use it! Then the host/concierge team showed their reactiveness, and hands on attitude, giving us a workable shower on a Sunday evening. I very much appreciate this attitude, so thanks Bavo (and your wife) for your Sunday evening plumbing skills!Local supermarkets nearby, free parking, in 100 steps you are on the sand already.

Carffoure supermarket only few min drive from the property. Plenty of parking space. There are 3 lifts to the property which is on the 8th floor. We went in winter so the balcony window was shut all the time, if you are staying in summer with children, be mindful of this as you don't want to play around in the balcony. Otherwise the property is safe with 2 secure entries. Restaurants is a bit further nearer towards Ostend . We visited Bruge twice during the Christmas festive and it's only 25/30 minutes drive away.

The hotel had beverages in the check-in area, so after traveling for over 2 1/2 hours, a couple of us took water and crémant. We didn't ask, but as there were glasses in a bowl, we thought it was for the guests. While waiting for everyone to comedown, one of my friends took another glass of crémant. The check-in lady got really mean and angry with her saying, ""it was a welcome drink and that she'd already had a drink."" There wasn't a sign posted ANYWHERE to indicate that and further more, she never mentioned or offered it to us at check in. We asked if we could have the wifi code and in her rude manner, she pointed out that it was on the card key. After shopping we returned to the hotel and one of my friends happened to read the back of the card key holder and saw that we could get a 10% discount on shopping at the Maasmechelen Village. The check-in agent knew that we were going shopping, but fail to tell us about this great deal. I will say that the check-in agent at check out was much nicer and seemed sympathetic to our problems with her colleague and would mention it to her.,

Definitely lack a more quality cosmetics in the bathroom (the one there is quite basic, something you can find in 3* hotels), no cosmetic pads...Small things like shoe polisher or coffee maker are lacking too, tea bags are not added each day.

At 21:58 I asked him when the pool is open till tomorrow, he responded: “We close at 10 pm” (I spoke Russian, it’s my mother’s tongue) and looked very serious and sort of impatient. I got an impression he wanted me out of the pool ASAP. There were a few staff members who were friendly, but overall my family and I were shocked by the service... At the time of check in I paid with my credit card and I was not even offered to leave a deposit. I had to come back next day and do it just in case... Your service is not up to the world’s standard.

We would like to stay there also in spring or summer, we are sure it's going to be even a better experience and we will love it.

Quite clean and quiet.",Couple,Stayed 1 night,34573,33673,86,1239
8832,Not worth the cost,8.9,5.4,"To start with, it was very strange that half of the amenities in the hotel were not working because they were broken / unavailable. I have NEVER encountered this in a 5* hotel. For instance, the bathtub in our room was broken - water was not flowing into the bathtub because the pipes were broken or unattached to the tub, for this reason water was flowing below the tub and not in it. We have checked under the tub and the entire space  was wet and mouldy. The shower head was not very well attached (or full of limescale), so the water was flowing outside the shower head and not through it. The shower tile was chipped. In the men's area of the spa,  jacuzzi was not working. How is this acceptable in a 5* hotel???
The staff appears to be not very well trained. Some members of the staff were very nice and helpful while others were downright rude. We have ordered a couple of items from the mini bar; as the mini bar was not filled upon our arrival, the lady came up to our room carrying all the contents of the mini bar. Trying to save her some trouble, I have told her that we only need a couple of items, so there is no need to fill the entire mini bar. She said quite rudely that this is not a restaurant so I cannot order whatever I want and proceeded to fill the entire mini bar. I am pretty sure that she could approached the matter differently. Some staff members do not speak English. If you address them in English they freak out and pass you along to their colleague. When they do speak English, they come out quite rude, e.g. asking ""what do you want?"" instead of ""how can I help you?"". Again, the lack of proper training is prominent. I have stayed in similarly priced 5* hotels in other countries and the staff goes above and beyond to ensure quality experience for their guests.
To be fair, we have not tried the breakfast, so maybe it would have improved our experience (breakfast was highly rated among other quests).,

I have very mixed emotions about this hotel. While I liked some aspects of it (beautiful lobby, spacious rooms, down pillows and duvet, cleanliness), some things have really let me down.",Couple,Stayed 1 night,34574,33674,57,1240

Located outside of town, sufficiently far away from the main road to be quiet yet very close to all amenities, the Daft Hotel is nested in a meadow next to the forest. There you find a modern building that also serves as recording studio. The music theme is thus predominant, both in the commons and in the rooms. We particularly enjoyed (for free) the swimming pool, the snooker table, and the home cinema room (cast from the iPad/Netflix that is provided at your arrival).

I called the personel 3 times yet they couldn't handle those animal guests. The neighbours were actually making fun of them and the security was completely helpless. In the end, I couldn't fell asleep that night until 4:00 A.M. Second thing - the restaurant. It is definitely too small for the size of the hotel. Between 7:30 and 9:30 it is nearly impossible to find a place for yourself. You need to sit with someone from another room. The food is really nice but please, set more tables for the guests.,

Location - the city center at its best, 7 minutes by walk to the ""Tsentralny"". Comfort and cleanliness - above my expectations. The rooms (we had two singles) were actually soundproof from the noise of the street",Family with young children,Stayed 3 nights,34890,33990,88,5484

9005,Good,8.7,7.5,"In reality there were quite a few issues. This is meant as constructive criticism...
- The road to the place has a massive ramp and you would want a sign at the end of the road where to turn, as you’re being blinded by the path lighting. It was icy but the paths weren’t cleared. 
- Rooms were very dark. Bathrooms were even darker, like a cave.
- No heating in the bathroom
- No hand soap, so had to get shower soap every time
- Bathrobes would have been great. 
- Please ask your guests to take a shower after the sauna, rather the jumping into the pool all sweaty. That’s disgusting. Maybe also ask them to generally take a shower before jumping into the pool. And to not flood the sauna by going directly from pool to sauna.
- A changing room downstairs would be great.
- There’s hardly and storage space in the room. A tiny shelf and 3 coat hangers is maybe a bit too minimal for a double room.
- Since there isn’t that much to do for kids, you’ll have every spot occupied by bored kids (pool, sauna, billiard, lounge, cinema). Maybe you could have a kids free time at the pool? Seems like the cinema and billiard don’t really crack it for kids these days, so they just sit in the lounge playing mobile games all day long, making it hard to relax for everyone else.
- The cinema is fun, unless someone starts a pokemon stream from their room but don’t actually occupy the cinema
- Most of this wouldn’t be a problem if you could chill in your room, but the walls are so thin we could hear our neighbors breathe!!! And snore and use the toilet and moan and play guitar hero for 4 hours. Totally unacceptable for a building used as a hotel.
- It’s a new building but there’s no elevator, so good luck if you’re on second floor and brought some luggage,

Theoretically this place has it all, modern/cool spot, lounge with fireplace, wellness, great surroundings, cinema, bar... All the staff were amazing and the breakfast was lovely. Could be perfect a retreat. But...",Couple,Stayed 2 nights,34908,34008,45,5492

9073,Fabulous,8,8.8,"i was in belgium for 12 days and although i travelled to other cities i booked accommodation only in brussels to avoid the hassle of moving hostels. imagine my surprise when i was forced to change rooms halfway through my stay (had to leave my room by midday store my stuff in luggage and come to a new room after 3pm basically checking out and back in later that day) and this was not communicated to me before i checked in - major inconvenience as i would not have stayed in brussels the entire time had i known this in time. on top of that the girl at front desk acted like she did me a favour by ensuring i didn't have to change rooms TWICE. first room was in an unincorporated area of the hostel only reachable through emergency stairs, no easy access to the kitchen, weird layout (two levels, stairs in weird places, sinks next to beds), unstable bunk beds, too few outlets and the only light was for the whole room. second room in the front part of the hostel was tiny and cramped, stuffy and the only window opened pretty much directly into the street. access to kitchen is very limited. wifi is spotty in parts and some of the staff is not particularly informative. the two parts of the hostel are completely separate which makes for a strange layout if you are in the wrong part.,

relatively close to both central and north station on foot or by traffic. well connected to public transport with stops for all metro lines as well as several buses and trams closeby. a number of attractions within walking distance including the congress column, botanical garden, brussels park, parliament, royal palace and grand place. a delhaize and carrefour store nearby as well as a couple of fast food places and pubs. overall in a good location.
the hostel itself is clean and well maintained. it has a lot of extra facilities including a luggage room and a well equipped kitchen, a cheap bar,  a balcony, a sitting area both inside and out, a laundry room and its own vending machines.  check in/check out is possible from early in the morning to late in the evening. staff speaks multiple languages and they are all very pleasant and polite. in collaboration with an agency a guide for a free walking tour picks up groups from the hostel twice a day which is very convenient. different free maps are available at front desk. there's free access to computers and the staff will print out your bus or plane tickets for free too.
the breakfast is great. there are a lot of different things to choose from, sweet and savory, different kinds of cured meat and cheese, eggs, butter, chocolate spreads, jams, different types of bread and milk (including soy milk) and cereal. there's always several types of fresh fruit. you can drink anything from water to juice to coffee to hot chocolate to all kinds of tea. the dining area has a toaster and a microwave. over a longer period it gets repetitive and it's not a replacement for a varied home-cooked diet, but it's a great hostel breakfast.
the rest of the experience depends largely on where in the hostel you are placed. my first room was very large and spacious with lots of windows, air and light. it was in a quiet part of the hostel overlooking a quiet street.",Solo traveller,Stayed 11 nights,35067,34167,16,5560

This is the most central hotel in Minsk from which one can easily get to the major attractions in the city as well as places to eat. The twin room we were staying in was on the spacious side overlooking the main street which is during most part of the day busy making noise and exhaust fumes - so there was no chance to open the window even in the evening. At the same time, the air-conditioning worked very well which meant there was no much need in letting cooler air in from the outside. The room and the whole property were very clean and tidy. On top of that, the staff at the reception and on the floor were extremely polite and welcoming which added up to the overall impression of the property and the offered facilities and conveniencies.

Due to Covid we ate in the room. Meals are possible from the restaurant's owner (meals are good) or from the neighbouring restaurants.
Due to the fact that there are no hotel facilities, you only have the room. Therefore it's a bit overpriced.,

When I arrived, around 20:00 hs, and went to my room and bed, discover that just the mattress haven't got sheets, the pillow did.
A forgetfulness, can happen.
When I've gone to the receptionist to comment about it, immediately went to handle it.
All my thanks!! That's how a situation should always be managed!
Didn't like that the distance between the lower and the upper beds, was really short. I'm tall, and there's no chance I could sit normally... or any way without be very bowed.
Neither liked much some parts of the stairs (narrow, unbalanced steps, low ceiling), nor some showers (same reasons, except for the steps, which haven't got)

When I have refused a price tag that was simply not possible they said they will call the police. They have also said that if I do not pay the hotel cleaner will have to - the handling of this incident and the level of agressiveness was just out of hand and disproportionate.

Breakfast was reduced to a pick nick bag with continental items, though paying full price. Everything in the bag was wrapped in plastic. So much waste!
We have stayed in other hotels during Covid, where breakfast was offered differently, but still full choice. A matter of management.
The staff is friendly, but lacking efficiency.
Also, for a Hotel in the middle of nature, most of the indoor plants were in plastic.

Reading other people's reviews I realised I was not the only one encountering this. I have never seen something like this in Holland. This is unacceptable for a (4-star) hotel. (see photo)While walking around outside its easy to forget that you're actually in Europe; the hotel is close to a train station; at night there are a lot of drug addicts, homeless and gipsies on the streets, sleeping outside or talking to you if you walk by. They come in big numbers. If you travel by car, especially one having a ''foreign'' license plate, it is highly advised to park it in the hotel garage. This costs you €25. Group of men hang around the parked cars outside, I witnessed one urinating against one. I personally wouldn't go out alone at night as a woman or with children. Be aware of pickpockets too.,

Rooms were very quiet, unlike many others hotels in Brussels. Reception staff spoke Dutch like they're supposed to.Overall, I've learnt that booking a hotel is always quite a gamble in Belgium, even at 4-5 star hotels, the quality standard is lower.

We had a beautiful room overlooking the canal and Our Lady's Church and Bonifacius Bridge. Again the best words that come to mind is just magical.
The room decor is beautiful and so in keeping with the medieval house. The bathroom offered comfort and luxury with all Hermes products.
Lynn looking after us so well and served us a beautiful breakfast each morning. She also helped us sort out food options for the evening as the restaurants were closed. 
My Fiance  is so in love with B&B Bonifacius we are booking in again for next Christmas.

9560,Very poor,7.8,2,"-The staff barely spoke English, they just kept talking French while I don’t speak French. Because of that, there were a lot of mistakes maken and miscommunication.
-The WIFI/signal was very very bad. The signal on the small TV aswell. We were not able to watch TV.
-The roomservice was disgusting. A lot of food on the menu wasn’t available. We ordered a pizza, and it was all burnt. We tried it another time, but it  was like a dry frozen pizza from the shop.
-The hotel keeps the doors closed. So we couldn’t come in, you have to ring a bell every time you want to come in and go out. When you arrive for first time it’s not told so it’s very uncomfortable. Sometimes, no one is at the reception. So they just let you keep waiting outside. This was very frustrating.
-They say they have a 24-hour reception, but unfortunately that’s not true.. We called reception multiple times around 1:00 in the night and no one picked up. They woke us up by calling us back in the morning why we were asleep ..
-Shower made a very hard and strange noise.
-Rooms were very noisy. There was a party with balloons in the room next to us and we heard everything. 
-At last communication was very bad. When ordering roomservice they don’t understand English, they say they will call you back 3 times while they don’t, and last but not least; you have to pick it up yourself at the bar downstairs...

The kitchen, bathroom and lounge were on the ground floor and the bedroom and another toilet on the upper mezzanine floor.

Construction work and busy people in the street before 6am not that Condo Gardens can do anything about this.  Not bad for the price though.,

There was a good amount of space. The kitchen was good. When we only had 1 fork and no teatowel in the kitchen the problem was solved quickly. Shop within walking distances.

At the arrival I got a rose, fruit in the room and welcome drink, cava or other. Next day we had home made cookies in the room. In the room at your disposal Nespresso coffee and bio tea. Also tea and coffee in the lobby are included in the room rate.Breakfast - is really amazing!!! The variety of bread, jams and hams. at your equest she prepares omelette or any other type of egg and pancakes. I fell in love with her home made bread with nuts and feagues. Cava, fresh orange juice, hot drinks are also served at the breakfast.This is a nice experience, not just an overnighting in an hotel. You won't regret it.

9768,Superb,9.5,9.2,"The hotel is located in a street that leads (cars) towards the center of Blankenberge, which means that there is quite a number of cars passing in front of the hotel during the day but also in the evening.Even though the hotel was being very pet friendly, Blankenberge somehow isn't. In a radius of 500 meters, there was only one tiny little green spot (around 20 m2 probably?) where dogs could do their job. This obviously has nothing to do with the hotel, but I feel like having to share it with other pet owners.Wat we also didn't like was the ""quietness"" of our room. I explicitly asked for a quite room because me and my wife have a very light sleep. Unfortunately we got a room on the 1rst floor, so we had rooms all around us except below us (Breakfast room and reception were below us). From the moment we arrived in our room the first day (around 14h00) until 03h00 at night (!!!) There were people above us moving things around, and heavily and PERMANENTLY walking up and down the room barefoot, working out for a marathon or something...!? (I am being sarcastic about the marathon of course) We didn't manage to rest a single minute after our long journey and neither did we get to sleep the first night. (The next 2 nights were perfectly fine though)Last, but not least, must we admit that one of the staff members were quite harsh to their guests mainly during breakfast. There was for example one other couple from Luxembourg and a German couple that really were not happy with the way that staff member talked to them and treated them, but the staff remained uninterested. Even though we did not have a negative experience, we found it quite disturbing to watch and hear this.,

The location of the Hotel was perfect, a short 10 minute walk to the beach and the town center made it very easy to enjoy the good weather. Also the room was very spacious, modern, clean, comfortable and in our case very pet friendly! Parking spaces are available at a nearby car park or in the streets around the hotel, both at cost though.Finally, the breakfast really was outstanding, I am keen to say that it might have been the best breakfast I have ever had in 30 years!",Leisure trip,Deluxe Double or Twin Room,36558,35658,23,5483

It was the dirtiest place I have ever stayed- I’m attaching a picture of the dirty/ceiling isolation stalactites because I’m not even sure what they are. The right one also had spiderwebs on it so they appear stagnant at least. The window curtains have weird red stains on them as well. The place is badly isolated- you can hear all your neighbors clearly and the courtyard very clearly- and the place is in a sketchy area (next to the city jail) so you hear a lot of sirens at a lot of times. Heating requires plugging in the electric heater- sockets are falling apart, see other reviews- and smells like something is burning (probably just dirt). Things got worse a few days in when the bathroom started strongly smelling like sewer, I complained to reception but they said the handyman had left and wouldn’t come back until the next day. The smell crept into the rest of the apartment, it was nauseating and made me dizzy. I ended up leaving a day early because I couldn’t take it anymore. If you’re considering staying here because (like me) you’re young and broke, consider staying in Brussels instead and commuting in by train. Seriously, don’t do this to yourself.,

Felt terrified to the point I couldn’t stay on the room I paid,7.2,2.5,"I had an incident with a man who wasn’t a guest walking through the hotel that knocked on my room door at 10 pm and was following after me. Building gates are open at all times, even during the night which makes it very unsafe. The receptionist named Jasmain called the police who came and interrogated the man. I have an Australian number so I couldn’t do it myself. But then, when I requested to move to a different room as the man knew exactly which one was my room number and where was located, the receptionist very rudely  denied saying that she was tired, she had a long day and she was hungry cause she didn’t eat anything in 24 hours. She said the hotel was fully booked which is not true, as I tried to make a new reservation and the option was still available. She also suggested for me to sleep in a mattress on my father bedroom which was one level up. But she said the housekeepers wasn’t there so I needed to it myself. When I told her if she could help me she denied and then when I requested for her to call the manager, she said she was the manager (only after 2 hours she identified herself as the manager) and she started screaming at me very loud and rude, even coursing me “god damn you” and then she left leaving me alone at midgnight terrified as the man following me could come back any moment as he wasn’t a guest, but the gates of the hotel were open widely. Easy access to my room and the whole hotel at any time by any person from the street. Extremely unsafe. I was terrified, so my father moved the mattress to his room and I slept in the floor. I paid for a room that I couldn’t use. Never been so mistreated in my life. Never been so terrified. The manager jasmien was rude and careless. Morning after, I heard another female guest complaining that her lock didn’t work so the door was open at all times.I repeat, extremely UNSAFE!!

One morning they had even run out of drinking water in the spa and I was informed that delivery would come after 12 o’clock, so several hours later! It took a few discussions and phone calls to arrange for bottle water instead. The crew was almost irritated by me asking although I had just come out sweaty from the gym. A few tips from my side:
• The tiny sport facility is a separate space. Put a water dispenser there, provide towels and keep it open around the clock! The spa can still be closed independently.
• Train your staff to understand the guests’ needs and think a little bit outside the box. Pay them extra for smiling, talking friendly and looking people in the eyes. 
• Make sure your supplies are efficient and your staff pro-active to keep the guests happy. It doesn’t take much!,
